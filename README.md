# Employee Tracker

This project is a system that uses a database to keep track of employees, their roles, departments, salaries and their direct managers.

Through CLI, users can add and view people, departments and roles, as well as update the epmolyee roles. 

This application will use MySQL to hold the data, and Iquirerjs for users to interact with the CLI.
